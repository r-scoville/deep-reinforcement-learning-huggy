### About
This script creates, trains, and evaluates a deep reinforcement learning (RL) agent with step-by-step explanation.
- Environment: Huggy the Dog (Unity environment created by [Thomas Simonini](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhuggingface.co%2Fspaces%2FThomasSimonini%2F) based on [Puppo The Corgi](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.unity.com%2Ftechnology%2Fpuppo-the-corgi-cuteness-overload-with-the-unity-ml-agents-toolkit))
- RL library: [ML-Agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents)
- Model: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
